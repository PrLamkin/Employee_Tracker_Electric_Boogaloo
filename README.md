Welcome to this weeks!: "How does this shit work?!?!??"

step 1. go into command prompt
step 2. navigate to the files and run: "Node index.js"
step 3. play around with the interface, you can view the people already given, add people into the list, view by department and etc.
step 4. Profit????

I would like to thank the people that made ice tea, for without them I wouldn't have been able to do this in one day. Alright, i'm going to bed.
